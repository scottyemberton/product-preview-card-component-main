## Overview
I followed along the great Kevin Powell to complete this project. His video for another, more advanced video is what brought me to Frontend Mentor, so I thought I would follow along to a simpler solution.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process
I followed along with Kevin Powell, taking notes and taking moments to experiment with different options.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I really like how he uses --specific-properties: equaling##, in a :root at the top of his CSS. This makes it real easy to manipulate things that are used across the html. Something I could see coming in handy for future updates to an existing site, etc. 

Another big thing was how he uses rem vs px for text. That's something I struggled with in my certification projects.

### Continued development

I had already planned to follow along with this project, then to tackle the first challenge myself. After learning so much, I am considering updating my current projects on my certification over on freeCodeCamp.

I'm sure many already know of him, but the clarity and accuracy in his demonstrations really helped a lot. He will break down stuff you already know, but he'll also show things that don't work and why among other things.
